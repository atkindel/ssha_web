## Annual Conference

Our 2019 conference will be held in Chicago on November 21-24, 2019. We meet every fall, usually in November. The location changes according to the following logic: once every three years in Chicago, once every three years somewhere on the ‘East Coast’ and once every three years somewhere else. Since 2010, the Association has extended its reach to include Canadian cities as possible locations. The conference involves over a thousand scholars from around the world, although graduate students and faculty from the leading American universities predominant.

### Hotel Information

**Important!!**

SSHA recognizes that you have a number of options when securing hotel accommodations for the annual meeting.  It is important to keep in mind that SSHA has made a major commitment to the Palmer House Hilton in order to secure a large block of quality hotel rooms at competitive prices in a convenient location.  SSHA is legally bound to fill these rooms.  Not to do so has severe financial implications for SSHA, both in 2019 and in years to come and will almost certainly raise your costs of attending future annual meetings.  If you require a hotel in Chicago, we would appreciate it if you would reserve your room at the Palmer House Hilton hotel.

SSHA has a special group rate of $272 single or double occupancy, per night plus tax.  The hotel has set up a special reservation site for the Social Science History Association.  To access the site and make your reservation, <a href="https://book.passkey.com/event/49897107/owner/1455/home?utm_campaign=282742271" target="_blank">click here</a>.

If you would like to reserve your room before or after the event dates shown, please call the Hilton Reservations Department directly at 1-877-865-5321 and reference group code SSH.  Group rates cannot be guaranteed after October 19, 2019.

### Awards and Grants

The Association promotes high quality scholarship through its awards program, which recognize the best work by a younger scholar and the best work by any scholar in our many fields. We also facilitate the participation of graduate students through a travel grant. Please note that students applying for these funds need to fill out the appropriate form and submit it along with their proposed to the network representatives. They will be informed of the result of that competition at the same time as they hear whether or not their paper has been accepted.
