## Presidents Book Award

A $1000 prize is awarded annually for a meritorious first work by an early-career scholar. Entrants are judged on scholarly significance, interdisciplinary reach, and methodological innovativeness within monographs analyzing past structures and events and change over time. Books with a copyright date of the previous year that are published within eight years of the author's Ph.D. are eligible for consideration.

Submissions for the 2020 SSHA Presidents Book Award will open soon. Submissions with a postmark of **TBA** (or earlier) will be accepted. Late entries will not be considered. Authors or publishers wishing to nominate a book should mail an author’s curriculum vitae and a copy of the nominated book to each member of the award committee.
