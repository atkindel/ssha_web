**SSHA 2020 update and Covid-19**

Planning for the 2020 annual meeting continues!  We have an exciting meeting planned around the theme of â€œPolitics, Society, and the Economy:  the Past and Today", and November is far enough in the future that it makes sense to continue planning our meeting as usual at the present time.
