## SSHA Networks

With scholars from history, economics, sociology, demography, anthropology, and other social sciences, the association brings together scholars in thematic networks where they can explore common questions.  Each network organizes its own call for papers and selects the bulk of the papers to be presented at the annual conference. This open, flexible, and non-hierarchical structure makes these networks particularly welcoming spaces for younger scholars and invigorating tonic for older academics.

### Migration/Immigration

The Migration/Immigration Network is part of the Social Science History Association (SSHA) and the European Social Science History Conference (ESSHC). The network strongly encourages an interdisciplinary approach to the study of migration and immigration and, as such, its ranks include historians, sociologists, economists, geographers as well as scholars who specialize in ethnic studies, American studies, and Latino/a and Chicano/a studies. Representing one of the largest presence at the SSHA's annual meetings, members of the network organize panels and roundtables that investigate migration movements within a transnational framework; explore their implications at the local, national, and international level; and analyze the impact that the movement of people, goods, and ideas have in a global context. Attendance at the conference provides participants with an excellent opportunity to learn about the most recent trends in the field, network with other fellow migration scholars, and participate in informal gatherings where new and exciting research ideas and collaborative projects come alive!
