### Migration/Immigration

The Migration/Immigration Network is one of the largest and most active networks at the SSHA. We strongly encourage an interdisciplinary approach to the study of migration and immigration and, as such, our ranks include historians, sociologists, economists, geographers as well as scholars who specialize in ethnic studies, American studies and Latino/a and Chicano/a studies.

Representing one of the largest presences at the SSHA’s annual meetings, members of the network organize panels and roundtables that investigate migration movements within a transnational framework; explore their implications at the local, national and international level; and analyze the impact that the movement of people, goods, and ideas have in a global context. Attendance at the conference provides participants with an excellent opportunity to learn about the most recent trends in the field, network with other migration scholars and participate in informal gatherings where new and exciting research ideas and collaborative projects come alive. In recent years, our network members have collaborated with other SSHA networks on panels and roundtables, these have included the following: Childhood & Youth; Family History/Demography; Labor, Race & Ethnicity; and, Women, Gender, and Sexuality.
