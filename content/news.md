<h3><b>SSHA Executive Committee Statement on Racism and History</b></h3>
<br />
<p><font size="4">Throughout the world, people have been outraged by George Floyd’s death at the hands of the police.  They have protested and demanded action, for his death was simply the latest chapter in a long and painful history of injustice, discrimination, and violent oppression visited upon African Americans.  Floyd’s death and the demonstrations that followed force us all to confront that history and to call for lasting change, change both in government policy and in our own behavior.</font></p>  
	
<p><font size="4">As officers and members of the executive committee of the Social Science Association, we support the protestors who call for action and condemnation of acts of racism.  We urge all members to reflect on the harm that our history causes African Americans, from deaths at the hands of the police to higher pandemic mortality rates and systemic inequality that keeps children from realizing their potential.  And we ask members to consider too how their own silence may aggravate that harm.</font></p>  
	
<p><font size="4">Most of us will conclude that we have to do something.  Some may redirect their research toward analyzing the sad consequences of our history.  Others may choose to protest and to work for lasting reform.</font></p>  

<p><font size="4">Other academic organizations have issued statements about the tragic events in our country, their historical roots, and the need for change.  We endorse the spirit of their suggestions, which  may help us decide what course of action to take.  Here are examples from associations of anthropologists, economists, historians, political scientists, and sociologists:</font></p>
