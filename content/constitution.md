- Assist and support the work of organizations in activities such as the operation of training programs to enable historians and other social scientists to learn social science methodology, or methods for the retrieval and archiving of quantitative historical data.
- Work to achieve maximum freedom of access for scholars to data of particular interest to social science historians.
- Take any other appropriate action which the members of the Association believe necessary to achieve the above objectives.
