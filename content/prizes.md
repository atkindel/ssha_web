## Book Prizes

The Association awards two annual prizes for outstanding books in social science history.

### President's Book Award

A $1000 prize is awarded annually for a meritorious first work by an early-career scholar. Entrants are judged on scholarly significance, interdisciplinary reach, and methodological innovativeness within monographs analyzing past structures and events and change over time. Books with a copyright date of the previous year that are published within eight years of the author's Ph.D. are eligible for consideration.

*The 2018 submission window for the President’s Book Award will open soon.  Stay tuned for details!*
