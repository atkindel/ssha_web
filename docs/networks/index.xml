      <description>Culture The culture network seeks work exploring culture in two ways. First, we are eager to engage and host discussions of “culture” in its narrower sense, examining forms of entertainment, media, and art as things in themselves alongside the sociological, historical, political, anthropological and economic contexts that explain the appeal, importance, and institutional basis of these expressions across history and around the world. Second, we seek discussions of culture in its much broader sense—the origins, structure, dynamics, and consequences of how people make sense of the world.</description>

      <description>Education, Knowledge, and Science The Education/Knowledge/Science (EKS) Network, as one of many parts of the Social Science History Association, brings together scholars across disciplines to the social studies of science, formal education, and processes of knowledge production in broadly historical terms. Current areas of special interest among those within the network include: education and social stratification by race, class, and gender; the history of K-12 and higher education institutions and practices; theoretical bases of social-scientific research; theoretical and methodological engagement between Science &amp;amp; Technology Studies and disciplinary traditions in the social sciences; the politics of expertise; and historical-comparative analyses of science, knowledge, and culture.</description>

      <description>Macrohistorical Dynamics Macrohistorical Dynamics (MHD) is an interdisciplinary social science research community that focuses on questions of large-scale, comparative historical inquiry and the epistemic and theoretical problems that arise at that level of inquiry. The network invites collaboration among historians, social scientists, and philosophers around the conceptual and historiographic problems that arise in large-scale historical inquiry. Contributors to the network have brought perspectives on a wide variety of problem areas, including macro- and historical sociology, world history, Eurasian comparisons, comparative study of civilizations, philosophy of history, globalization, and studies of long-term ecological, technological, demographic, cultural, and political processes.</description>

Representing one of the largest presences at the SSHA’s annual meetings, members of the network organize panels and roundtables that investigate migration movements within a transnational framework; explore their implications at the local, national and international level; and analyze the impact that the movement of people, goods, and ideas have in a global context.</description>

It rests upon the interdependence between people and land, historically and today, and the effects on humans and nature from this interdependence. Although most panels in recent meetings have addressed these questions focusing on Europe and North America during the last two centuries, panels covering other parts of the world and earlier time periods have also been arranged regularly.</description>
