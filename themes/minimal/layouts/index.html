                        <h4>The Social Science History Association is an interdisciplinary organization that publishes a journal, <em>Social Science History</em>, organizes an annual conference, supports graduate student travel to the conference, and awards book prizes.
                            <br> <br>
                            With scholars from history, economics, sociology, demography, anthropology, and other social sciences, the association brings together scholars in thematic networks where they can explore common questions.
                            <br> <br>
                            Each network organizes its own call for papers and selects the bulk of the papers to be presented at the annual conference. This open, flexible, and non-hierarchical structure makes these networks particularly welcoming spaces for younger scholars and invigorating tonic for more seasoned academics.</h4>
